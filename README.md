1. R's Shiny Visualization
   I was able to follow the instructions with out any major issues.
3. Python's Shiny Visualization
   I had an issues where pip freeze would occur but this was resolved once I added a requirements.txt file
3. Flask with Matplotlib Visualization
   The only challenge I faced was becuase of user error. When entering the source code of the database, I linked to the database in github but not the actual raw file.
